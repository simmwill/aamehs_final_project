Save objects created in R using `saveRDS`

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(haven)

# Import data as example
data = read_xpt('./data/DEMO_11_12.xpt')

# Modify
data_modify =
  data %>% 
  select(SEQN,
         sex = RIAGENDR,
         age = RIDAGEYR)

# Export to our data folder
saveRDS(data_modify, file = "./data/test.RDS")               # Make sure to include .RDS on end of whatever you name file

```

Then you can load the object from another code file by using `readRDS`

```{r}

import_data =
  readRDS("./data/test.RDS")

# import_data and data_modify are the same
```
